# DJHub

This is the central repository for DJHub, an in-browser DJ software that allows you to record and stream DJ sets.

Currently, the app is under development. It will have a microservices structure dedicated to file storage and live streaming. Please note that this structure is subject to change, but it provides me with an opportunity to learn about microservices. I am planning to use WebMidiJs to interact with the DJ controller on the front-end side and NestJs for the microservices.

Below are the repositories involved in the project.
